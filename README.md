Current status:
- [x] Scripts to convert data and read file (Jingning).
- [x] Initial CPU code (Jingning).
- [ ] Initial GPU code (Venkat).
- [ ] Start optimization (right after final exam).

test1.tsv and test2.tsv are toy example to test the functionality of the CPU code. Convert them to bel file before using.
* test1 is from the graphChallengeSerial code (see the comments in runKtrussBenchmark.py).
* test2 is from the lecture slides.

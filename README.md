Current status:
- [x] Scripts to convert data and read file (Jingning).
- [x] Initial CPU code (Jingning).
- [ ] Initial GPU code (Venkat).
- [ ] Start optimization (right after final exam).

test1.tsv and test2.tsv are toy example to test the functionality of the CPU code. Convert them to bel file before using.
* test1 is from the graphChallengeSerial code (see the comments in runKtrussBenchmark.py).
* test2 is from the lecture slides.

serial.cpp contains the CPU version of the code. test.cpp is only for initial testing on file reading scripts. Might remove it later.

Future Timeline:
1. Start optimization after final exam.
2. Thursday (4/25) clinic.
3. Initial optimization and check-in on weekend (4/26 - 4/27)
4. Check-in every other day until demo day.
5. Start to work on slides at least two days before the presentation.
6. Start report at least 3-4 days before last day.
